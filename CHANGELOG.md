## [2.1.5] - 2026-04-17


### Added

- Add HSM support with PyKCS11 and improve fd leak protection (#217) (679f69b)
- Add comprehensive test coverage for secure_memory, crypto_api, and PQC backends (#230) (6deb1be)

### Fixed

- Fix three cryptographic audit findings; restore INVARIANT-13 with 52 tracked suppressions (#218) (2fa49e8)

### Security

- Security audit fixes: length-prefixed encoding, constant-time ops, and validation (#224) (b700050)
- PR #224 Follow-up: Add comprehensive test coverage for security audit fixes (#226) (ca8f357)

### Security — PR #224 Follow-up (Wire-Incompatible Changes)

The following changes from PR #224 are **deliberately wire-incompatible** with
prior versions.  They address security audit findings and MUST NOT be reverted
for backward compatibility.

- **Hybrid combiner HKDF construction (audit finding C6):** Salt and info fields
  now use fixed-size length-prefixed encoding to prevent ambiguous
  concatenation and component stripping attacks: component counts are encoded
  as `u8(count)`, and ciphertext/public-key fields are encoded as
  `u32be(len(field)) || field`.  Keys derived with the v2.1.4 construction
  will differ from v2.1.5+.
- **Secure channel protocol version bump (v1 → v2):** AAD now includes
  `rekey_epoch` to prevent multi-target tag forgery across key epochs (audit
  finding H2).  `PROTOCOL_VERSION` changed from `\x01` to `\x02`.
- **`ama_ed25519_scalar_mult` → `ama_ed25519_scalarmult_public` rename (audit
  finding C7):** A `#define` macro provides **source compatibility only** (not
  ABI).  Downstream C consumers linking against the shared library must
  recompile.
- **INVARIANT-7 enforcement in `HybridCombiner.combine()`:** Now raises
  `RuntimeError` instead of falling through to the Python HKDF fallback when the
  native C backend is unavailable.

### Changed — Code Hygiene (PR #224 Follow-up)

- Promoted inline magic numbers `_MAX_CT_BYTES`, `_MAX_SS_BYTES` (hybrid
  combiner) and `_MAX_FIELD_BYTES` (secure channel) to module-level named
  constants
- Added safety docstring to `HybridCombiner._hkdf_python()` marking it as
  internal test-only fallback (not constant-time; may only be used with
  controlled test inputs such as test vectors, never for production/live
  secret handling)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for `HandshakeResponse.deserialize()`
  validation paths (truncated, malformed, oversized inputs)
- Added test coverage for `create_handshake()` KEM encapsulation result
  validation (empty/invalid shared secret, empty ciphertext)
- Added regression test proving length-prefixed HKDF encoding prevents
  ambiguous concatenation attacks
- Added test coverage for `encapsulate_hybrid()` / `decapsulate_hybrid()`
  input validation (empty, oversized, non-bytes)

---
## [2.1.4] - 2026-04-14

### Security

- **CodeQL #297 (File is not always closed):** Guarded `os.fdopen()` calls in `legacy_compat.py` with explicit `os.close(fd)` on failure, matching the pattern used in `crypto_api.py`

### Added

- `AmaHSMUnavailableError` exception class in `ama_cryptography.exceptions` — always importable without PyKCS11 or native C library; raised instead of bare `ImportError` for missing HSM dependency
- `HSMKeyStorage.destroy_key()` alias for `delete_key()` for API symmetry
- feat(frost): add FROST threshold Ed25519 signing (RFC 9591) with KeypairCache (#193) (a8b23fa)

### Changed

- `HSM_AVAILABLE` module-level flag via `importlib.util.find_spec("PyKCS11")` — no import binding, no unused-import CodeQL alert
- `HSMKeyStorage._import_pykcs11()` now raises `AmaHSMUnavailableError` instead of `ImportError` for consistent exception contract
- Removed `PostureAction.HALT` enum value (unwired: no evaluator path produced it, `_execute_action` had no handler)
- feat: Cherry-pick audit fixes — AVX-512 stub, context API, benchmarks, ruff S110 hardening (#213) (caaedd0)
- chore: Consolidate completed dependency updates from Dependabot PRs #200-#208 (#212) (eee1e72)
- ci: Bump actions/upload-artifact from 7.0.0 to 7.0.1 (#196) (359d364)
- ci: Bump docker/build-push-action from 7.0.0 to 7.1.0 (#198) (5d8075e)
- ci: Bump trufflesecurity/trufflehog from 3.94.2 to 3.94.3 (#197) (fcf9f51)

---
## [2.1.3] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed — CodeQL Alert Resolution

- **Alert #343 (test_pqc_backends_coverage.py:264):** Replaced explicit `__del__()` call with `del`/`gc.collect()` pattern; finalizer verified via `finalizer_error_count()` before/after (INVARIANT-3 compliant)
- **Alert #272 (test_hsm_integration.py:628):** Replaced explicit `__del__()` call with `del`/`gc.collect()` pattern; mock assertions preserved
- **Alert #345 (legacy_compat.py:463, 473):** Replaced `try/except BaseException` fd wrapper with flat `with os.fdopen(fd, "wb")` pattern CodeQL traces natively — both occurrences fixed
- **Alert #20 (ama_ed25519.c:314):** Removed contradictory `__attribute__((hot))`, added `AMA_UNUSED` annotation to `ge25519_p1p1_to_p2` (function retained for future scalar multiplication)

---

## [2.1.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed - Critical Bug Fixes

- **SVE2 NTT correctness:** Fixed missing `lo_buf` store in `ama_dilithium_ntt_sve2` — butterfly low-half was never extracted to memory before Montgomery reduction, causing silent data corruption on AArch64 SVE2 platforms
- **NEON SHA3 Chi step:** Removed unused NEON vector variables in `ama_keccak_f1600_neon` Chi computation; replaced with correct scalar implementation
- **SHA2 header:** Added missing `<limits.h>` include to `ama_sha2.h` for portable `UINT_MAX`/`INT_MAX` usage
- **AVX2 Dilithium:** Added `AMA_UNUSED` annotation to `caddq_avx2` to resolve compiler warnings (function retained for future NTT post-processing)
- **Alert #318 (legacy_compat.py:474):** Fixed file descriptor not always closed — replaced `_open_fd` context manager with inline `os.fdopen()` try/with pattern that CodeQL traces natively
- **Alert #333 (ama_dilithium_avx2.c:77):** Resolved unused static function CodeQL alert

### Changed - CI/CD Improvements

- **Auto-docs workflow:** Replaced direct commit-and-push to `main` with PR-based flow using `gh pr create`, avoiding direct writes to protected branches
- **Workflow permissions:** Added `pull-requests: write` permission to `auto-docs.yml`
- **CI build matrix:** Added Windows MSVC to `ci-build-test.yml`; dropped `--no-build-isolation` from pip install
- **setup.py:** Added `ama_cryptography_monitor` as `py_module`; refactored `CMakeBuild.run()` to separate Cython extension builds from CMake library build; removed duplicate `super().run()` in `_build_cmake()` and unnecessary sentinel filtering

### Added - Compliance & Licensing

- **ed25519-donna LICENSE:** Added public domain license file for vendored ed25519-donna library
- **NOTICE:** Added third-party software attribution for ed25519-donna

### Changed - Documentation

- Synchronized all documentation dates to 2026-04-06 across 20+ files (README, ARCHITECTURE, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, wiki, and all standards/compliance documents)
- Updated version references to consistent `2.1.2` format across wiki and README

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-26

### Documentation Corrections (PR #142)

- **C1-C5 documentation corrections:** Standardized "6-layer" terminology to "multi-layer" across README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, wiki/Architecture.md, and ENHANCED_FEATURES.md
- **Layer architecture clarification:** Distinguished 4 core cryptographic operations (SHA3-256, HMAC-SHA3-256, Ed25519, ML-DSA-65) from supporting infrastructure (HKDF, RFC 3161, canonical encoding)
- **ML-DSA-65 signature size:** Corrected from 3,293 to 3,309 bytes per FIPS 204
- **Removed "production-grade" claims:** Replaced with accurate "community-tested, not externally audited" language
- **CI security audit fix:** Added CVE-2026-4539 (pygments ReDoS) exclusion to pip-audit across all CI workflows

### Changed - Dependency Consolidation (PR #140)

- Consolidated Dependabot PRs #130-#136 into a single CI/deps update

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### Changed - CI & Toolchain Overhaul (PR #116)

Resolved all CI failures with surgical, security-hardened fixes:

- **HMAC-SHA512 (INVARIANT-1 compliance):** Replaced stdlib `hmac` import with hand-rolled `_hmac_sha512()` in `key_management.py`, eliminating the last stdlib crypto dependency
- **Linter migration:** Fully replaced flake8 + isort with **ruff** (`ruff==0.15.6` pinned in `requirements-lock.txt`); updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `Makefile`
- **Semgrep security scan:** Added Semgrep to CI pipeline (fail-closed), enforcing static security analysis on every PR
- **mypy --strict:** Now passes with 0 errors; mypy `python_version` bumped from `3.8` to `3.9` (mypy >=1.14 dropped 3.8 support); minimum Python bumped to 3.9
- **CVE-2026-26007 mitigation:** Pinned `cryptography>=46.0.5` in all CI workflows
- **cyclonedx-bom pinned:** `cyclonedx-bom==7.2.2` for reproducible SBOM generation
- **TruffleHog SHA bumped:** Updated to `d17df484…` commit SHA for secret scanning
- **MSVC shared library:** Switched from `WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS` to explicit `AMA_API` (`__declspec(dllexport)`) macros for controlled symbol visibility
- **Native C `ama_consttime_memcmp` loader:** Added to `secure_memory.py` for hardware-speed constant-time comparison via ctypes

### Added - Phase 2 Cryptographic Primitives (PR #92)

Expanded the native C cryptographic library with additional primitives:

- **`ama_x25519.c`**: X25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange (RFC 7748) — used as classical component in hybrid KEM combiner
- **`ama_chacha20poly1305.c`**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD (RFC 8439) — constant-time alternative to AES-256-GCM for shared-tenant environments
- **`ama_argon2.c`**: Argon2id memory-hard password hashing (RFC 9106) — configurable memory/time cost
- **`ama_secp256k1.c`**: secp256k1 elliptic curve operations — BIP32-compliant HD key derivation support

All 64 CI jobs passing after Phase 2 integration.

### Added - Constant-Time Testing & Fuzzing Infrastructure (PR #94)

- 11 coverage-guided fuzzing harnesses (libFuzzer) for all cryptographic primitives
- dudect-style constant-time verification harness with Welch's t-test (|t| < 4.5 threshold)
- Comprehensive threat model documentation (`THREAT_MODEL.md`) with threat catalog, mitigations, and verification matrix

### Changed - Benchmark Refactoring (PR #95)

- Refactored benchmark suite to target native C backend with updated performance baselines
- Removed legacy Python-only benchmarks that no longer reflect v2.0 architecture

### Changed - Import System Refactoring (PR #96)

- Refactored lazy loading to eager imports for math modules when numpy is available
- Fixed code quality issues identified during import system audit
- Improved error messages when optional dependencies are missing

### Fixed - Windows CI Resilience (PR #93)

- Made Windows CMake install resilient to Chocolatey CDN outages
- Added fallback mechanisms for package manager failures in CI

### Documentation Updates (2026-03-10)

- **Composition protocol clarification**: All documentation now accurately states that AMA Cryptography uses standardized primitives with an original composition protocol
- **Mercury Agent integration**: Documented AMA Cryptography's role as the cryptographic protection layer for [Mercury Agent](https://github.com/Steel-SecAdv-LLC/Mercury-Agent)
- **Ethical pillar redesign**: Consolidated from 12 named pillars to 4 Omni-Code Ethical Pillars (Omniscient, Omnipotent, Omnidirectional, Omnibenevolent), each governing a triad of three sub-properties (Wisdom, Agency, Geography, Integrity)
- **Phase 2 primitives**: Added X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2, secp256k1 to all relevant documentation

### Security Hardening

- **AES-256-GCM S-box documentation:** Corrected header comments that falsely claimed "bitsliced S-box". The implementation uses a standard 256-byte lookup table on round-key XOR'd state (public data). Added explicit side-channel caveat for shared-tenant environments.
- **Ed25519 thread safety:** Replaced `volatile int` check-then-set pattern with C11 `_Atomic` using `memory_order_acquire`/`memory_order_release` for base point and precomputed table initialization. Includes pre-C11 `volatile` fallback for MSVC/older compilers.
- **Ed25519 field arithmetic:** Replaced generic `fe25519_mul(h, f, f)` squaring with dedicated `fe25519_sq()` that exploits `f[j]*f[k] == f[k]*f[j]` symmetry, reducing ~100 multiplications to ~55 per squaring. Based on SUPERCOP ref10 `fe_sq`.
- **Ed25519 verification fixed:** Sign/verify roundtrip now passes RFC 8032 Test Vector 1 (public key, empty-message signature, and verification). Previously skipped due to field arithmetic issues.

### Changed

- **Ed25519 test suite:** Expanded from 6 tests (sign-only) to 12 tests including RFC 8032 KAT vector matching, full sign/verify roundtrip, tamper detection (modified signature and message rejection), and deterministic signature verification.
- **Ed25519 code cleanup:** Replaced verbose element-by-element `p3->p2` coordinate copying with `ge25519_p3_to_p2()` helper using `fe25519_copy()`.

### Added - Native C Cryptographic Library

Implemented native C cryptographic primitives for high-performance operations:

- **`ama_sha3.c`**: SHA3-256, SHAKE128, SHAKE256 with streaming API (init/update/final)
- **`ama_hkdf.c`**: HKDF-SHA3-256 with HMAC-SHA3-256 per RFC 5869
- **`ama_ed25519.c`**: Ed25519 keygen/sign/verify with windowed scalar multiplication
- **`ama_kyber.c`**: ML-KEM-1024 with NTT, inverse NTT, Montgomery reduction
- **`ama_dilithium.c`**: ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) with rejection sampling
- **`ama_sphincs.c`**: SPHINCS+-SHA2-256f (FIPS 205) with WOTS+/FORS/Hypertree
- **`ama_aes_gcm.c`**: AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption (NIST SP 800-38D)
- **`ama_consttime.c`**: Constant-time memcmp, memzero, swap, lookup, copy

### Added - Constant-Time Verification

- dudect-style Welch's t-test timing analysis harness for all 5 constant-time functions
- Threshold: |t| < 4.5 (dudect convention, ~10^-5 false positive probability)

### Added - Strict Type Checking

- Type annotations on all functions in `crypto_api.py`, `secure_memory.py`, `key_management.py`, `double_helix_engine.py`
- Enabled `disallow_untyped_defs = true` in mypy; `continue-on-error: false` in CI

### Added - Ethical Integration

- 12-dimensional ethical vector (4 triads x 3 pillars) cryptographically bound via SHA3-256
- `create_ethical_hkdf_context()`: integrates ethical vector into HKDF context parameter
- CryptoPackage schema extended with `ethical_vector` and `ethical_hash` fields
- Mathematical proof in SECURITY.md

### Changed - HKDF Algorithm Unification

**BREAKING:** `derive_keys()` now uses HKDF-SHA3-256 instead of HKDF-SHA256. Keys derived with v1.0.0 will differ. Regenerate all derived keys after upgrade.

### Improved - Code Quality

- Audited all 32 silenced checks (type: ignore, noqa, nosec, pragma: no cover)
- 94% confirmed necessary; 2 unnecessary `# noqa: E402` fixed; 2 unused variables removed

### Bug Fixes

- **ama_sha3.c:** Fixed undefined behavior in `rotl64()` when n=0 (64-bit shift by 64 is UB)
- **ama_ed25519.c:** Added missing `#include <stdlib.h>` for macOS clang compatibility

### Migration Guide

After upgrading to v2.0:
1. Regenerate all derived keys (HKDF algorithm changed)
2. Update CryptoPackage consumers for new `ethical_vector`/`ethical_hash` fields
