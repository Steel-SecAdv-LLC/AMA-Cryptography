# AMA Cryptography — Architectural Invariants

> **Policy document.** Every PR that touches `ama_cryptography/`, `.github/workflows/`,
> or `tests/` **must** satisfy all four invariants below.
> Reviewers: reject any PR that violates them.

---

## INVARIANT-1 — Zero External Crypto Dependencies

**NEVER:** Introduce ad-hoc or unreviewed cryptographic constructions. All primitives must follow published NIST/IETF specifications and pass KAT validation.

**Do NOT introduce or depend on third-party cryptographic packages**
(`libsodium`, `pynacl`, `cryptography`, OpenSSL bindings, etc.).

Python stdlib modules (`hashlib`, `os`, `secrets`) are permitted for
non-primitive operations (OS entropy, hashing). They **must NOT** be used as a
substitute for AMA's own implementations of HMAC, memory zeroing, or core
cipher operations.

**`hmac` module policy:** `hmac.compare_digest()` is permitted for constant-time
comparison. `hmac.new()` / `hmac.HMAC()` are not permitted — use AMA's own HMAC
implementations.

## INVARIANT-2 — Fail-Closed CI

Security-critical CI steps (pip-audit, bandit, Semgrep, KAT tests when oqs is
present, secret scanning) **must not** use `continue-on-error: true`.
Failures in these steps **must** block the pipeline.

## INVARIANT-3 — Observable Failure States

- No bare `except …: pass` that swallows security-relevant errors.
- No bare `return` that silently skips a test — use `pytest.skip(reason=…)`.
- No `2>/dev/null` or other stderr suppression in workflow scripts.
- Mock assertions must verify **call signatures**, not just call occurrence.

## INVARIANT-4 — Pinned Action References

All third-party GitHub Actions used in security workflows **must** be pinned
to a full commit SHA, not a mutable tag (`@main`, `@v1`, etc.).
